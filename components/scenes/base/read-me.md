# Scene: Index Component

This scene component provides the theme for the web app. Using styled-components theme provider context I can pass through [mulitple themes](https://styled-components.com/docs/advanced) (dark mode).

The scene can be connected to global state (Reducers).SCenes are a collection of display and user-inputs eg "register form".
